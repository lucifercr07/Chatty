**Chatty**

Chatty is a Java based chat application which currently is capable of enabling communication between
a single client and server.

The communication between client and server is performed by opening a websocket connection between
client and server.

In future the server will be capable of:

1. Including authentication of client who wants to use the application.
2. Handling requests from multiple clients concurrently.
3. Taking backup of messages of all the registered clients.
